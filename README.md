> This is an android APP built with react-native that plans a travel automatically.

Sometimes planning a travel is an exhausting job. The APP asks users a set of interesting questions where the responses are used to inspect the users personalities. Based on the result, it automatically recommends a themed travel plan that matches the users personalities. The process is designed in a way so that it is fun and effortless to the users.
